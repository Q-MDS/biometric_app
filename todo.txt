Procedure.
1. User arrives at a page. 

7. Biometric must be part of register
7a. Detect if biometrics is supported, if so present option to use BM
8. Last part or register is Login with biometric Y/N. Still add passwords and have button for login with bio
9. User clicks on bio btn and goes to screen where I guess it will ask whether to use face or fprint
10. User chooses one and then does wizard: get public key
11. We use the public key and create a signature with the register data and send it to PHP
12. PHP gets register data and public key
13. Store public key with user record
14. Store user data from register

Login
1. User goes to BM screen
2. Does FP scan
3. Scan is good
4. Create a payload from timestamp
5. Create a signature from the payload and add a msg like Confirmation
6. Send data to php -> {useridentifier: email & pwd, signature: signature, payload: payload}
7. PHP: use the email & pwd to ge the public key stored in register process
8. Get payload & signature
9. PHP: do that openssl to verify the signature
10. If sig is verified then all good.
11. Normal process: delete token, create token and return


4. Generate some login data (timestamp, "confirmed")
5. Create a signature
6. Send to server



2. Detect biometrics
3. Prompt user if they would like to use biometrics to login
4. N = Login screen, remember and forgot. Add button Use biometrics.
5. Y = bio login screen. Add button use password [Goes to login screen]
6. Need a database flag to show login preference. 0 - new, 1 - password, 2 - biometrics
